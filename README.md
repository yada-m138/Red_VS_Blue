## Project RED VS BLUE
In this project, We will act as a security engineer supporting an organization's SOC infrastructure. 
The SOC analysts have noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system and the manager has asked the security engineering team to investigate 
and confirm that newly created alerts are working.
